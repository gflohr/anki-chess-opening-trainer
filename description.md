This extension creates an Anki deck from a collection of chess games in PGN
format.

## Quickstart

To study an opening repertoire do this:

1) Install the add-on.
2) Create one or more [studies on Lichess](https://lichess.org/study) and export as PGN.
3) Import it into Anki with Tools -> Chess Opening Trainer
4) Study

PGNs imported for white should contain only white moves that you *want* to play
and black moves that you want to be prepared against. For black do the same but
with colours swapped.

## Other Features

### Update Repertoire

You can edit the studies/PGN files and re-import them without losing any
learning progress.  A new card is only created if a new position for the
selected colour is added.  Otherwise, the existing card is updated only.

### Board Diagrams

All notes contain a graphical board representation of the position in question
on both sides of the notes.

You can also add comments, annotations like "?" or "??", or lines, arrows,
and circles.  They are only displayed on the answer side of the card.

### Variations

PGN files can contain multiple games and each game can be arbitrarily nested.
The add-on uses all games and all variations and creates cards for them all.

### Translations

The add-on is currently available in these languages:

* (American) English
* (British/Australian) English
* German

Please get in touch with the author if you want to contribute a new translation!
