This extension creates a deck with chess openings from a collection of chess
games in PGN format.  If you select "white" as the colour, when importing the
file, all black moves become questions, and all white replies to that move
will become a reply.  For "black" it is the other way round.

If you re-import a game collection, its contents will be merged into the
deck.  Positions that are no longer present in the game collection will be
deleted in the deck.

All notes contain a graphical board representation of the position in question
on both sides of the notes.
