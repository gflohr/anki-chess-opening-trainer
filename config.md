# Configuration for Opening-Trainer

This is not really a configuration but rather a cache for the last options you
have selection via the graphical user interface.  Consequently, all
modifications that you make here will be overwritten as soon as you import
another deck.

## `colour`

The last colour that you had selected, either "white" or "black".

## `decks`

This holds the last deck that you have selected for each colour of the board.

### `decks.white
`
The last deck that you have selected for white.

### `decks.black`

The last deck that you have selected for black.

## `files`

This holds the last filenames for each colour.

### `files.white`

The last list of files you had selected for white.

### `files.white`

The last list of files you had selected for black.

## `notetype`

The last notetype that you have selected. This should be a note type with
two blank sides, each with exactly one field.  This normally ships with Anki
and is called "Basic".
